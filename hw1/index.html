<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>
<p>In this homework we implemented an SVG rasterizer. This involved rasterizing single-color triangles, as well as supersampling to implement antialiasing. Further, we implemented the ability to use transforms and color triangles by interpolation. Finally, we implemented the ability to switch between nearest-neighbor and bilinear sampling for textures, as well as implementing mipmapping (using textures of differing resolutions in different parts of a render for antialiasing). Those features are also implemented with the aim of increasing ways to achieve antialiasing. Ultimately, we found it pretty interesting to consider the mathematical backgrounds of a lot of features of rendering and graphics like this--getting insight into how antialiasing works was quite interesting in seeing all the differing ways it could be achieved.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>We have to make a few observations before we can begin to rasterize triangles. First, we must recognize that if we tried to test if every single point on the screen was within the bounds of every triangle, our GPU would explode violently. Since that would be bad, we first establish a bounding box around the triangle using its corner points. Then, within this box, it suffices for us to first check if each point (corresponding to the midpoint of each pixel) is inside the triangle. Note that this means we can't be doing any worse than an algorithm that checks each sample within the bounding box, since this is precisely what we do. For this, we have created an inside() method which takes in the vertices of the triangle, the point in question, and the triangle's winding order. The winding order is needed because we determine the inside-ness of a point to a triangle based on the formula from lecture--that is, functionally a three-line test. This method, because it is based on the normal vectors of the sides of the triangle, necessitates that the vectors point towards the inside of the triangle--that is to say, if the winding order is reversed, the same equations give an opposite-sign result. So, we simply account for this by reversing the desired sign of an inside point in our booleans. From there, if this point is inside the triangle, we place the given color at the right index in the sample buffer (used for now because it's needed when we supersample later). We also have a check to ensure we don't accidentally index outside of the sample buffer.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Our supersampling algortithm works by sampling each pixel in screen space N times in even intervals
   within the pixel instead of just the center as in the non supersampled case and averaging the value
   when finally rendering to the framebuffer. This is accomplished by calculating the interval at which
   we should sample within a screen pixel which every 1/(1+Sqrt(SuperSample_Rate)) and sampling at those 
   intervals in both the x and y positionand storing each color within the supersample buffer. The supersample 
   buffer is laid out as an array of height*(width*supersample_rate) Color objects and supersamples 
   for a given screen space pixel are stored sequentially within the array for simplicity's sake. When 
   the image needs to be rendered to the screen, simply go through each screen space pixel and average 
   the supersample pixel colors. Compatibility with the existing pixel and line drawing algorithms was maintained
   by having modifying fill_pixel to fill all fields in the supersample array with the pixel color
   By supersampling the edges of triangles and averaging the colors, we 
   are able to create a smoother gradient at the edges of triangles which can reduce the aliasing from 
   our low sample rate, at the expense of extra compute cost. When implementing this part of the homework,
   we experienced significant difficulty writing the supersampling code finding indexing errors which caused the
   target to appear duplicated or shifted. These issues were found to be due to casting order differences causing
   us to index into garbage addresses within our supersample buffer and were a source of much consternation.</p>

   <p>
    Looking at test4.svg, we can see that without any supersampling, the thin magenta triangle experiences significant
    aliasing when using nearest neighbor pixel sampling since the tip of a triangle is smaller than a pixel width, we
    get parts that are seemingly randomly rendered or not. This gradually decreases as we increase the supersample rate
    as now we can average the pixel's color across more tests which can help fill in the missing tip with a lighter shade
    to represent how it is supposed to be thinner, reducing aliasing. This also applies elsewhere within the image and All
    of the triangle edges look much smoother and less aliased.

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are a system of coordinates where each coordinate can be thought of as how close a point is to
   each corresponding vertex and is the relative area of the triangle opposite of that vertex formed by extending a line
   from each vertex to the point. These barycentric coordinates can used as weights for interpolating the colors at each
   vertex across the entire triangle by summing the product of each color with that vertex's corresponding barycentric
   coordinate. This in effect is a weighted average of the vertex colors based on the the pixel's position within the 
   triangle. To integrate this into the triangle rasterizer, instead of simply placing a single color into the supersample
   buffer when we find we are in the triangle, we can do this interpolation to find the color to place instead and our existing
   code takes care of the supersampling and averaging process to render the pixels on the screen. Below is an example of a triangle with one red, one green, and one blue corner being interpolated in this way, as well as test 7.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>


<p>The general idea behind pixel sampling in order to map textures is that we need a way to ensure that each triangle that's supposed to be textured is colored appropriately even if the surface it represents is transformed in some arbitrary way. This necessitates converting between screen coordinates and coordinates in texture space (u, v). In the basic case, nearest sampling, all we needed to do was determine which point in the texture was the closest to our desired point we need to texture (u, v), and simply use that color value. This works, but it's not always ideal. In cases where the colors change rapidly/many pixels of different colors are very close together in the texture, bilinear interpolation may be better suited to prevent aliasing. More specifically, using bilinear interpolation, we use the four nearest points in the texture that form a "box" around our point (u, v) and interpolate between them all, in effect creating a weighted average that we use as our result (aka, linear interpolation). This can reduce sharp edges in images that can make aliasing more noticeable. Examples of the two methods can be seen below.</p>

</div>

<p>As can be clearly seen, the largest difference is made when supersampling is not used (or similarly, when supersampling is done only to a low degree). This is because in effect, using nearest neighbor sampling with 16x samples per pixel is not that different from using bilinear sampling with 1 sample per pixel when it comes to antialiasing--in both cases, the ultimate color of a pixel is the product of an average of multiple points in the texture. In the case of bilinear sampling, it's a weighted average of surrounding points, whereas in nearest neighbor with supersampling, this average (produced by downsampling) is not weighted. On the other hand, when supersampling is not used, the difference tends to be more pronounced, especially in places with pixels of very different colors close together (like the lines on the map seen above). This is because bilinear sampling is still computing this weighted average in this case, but when not supersampling, nearest neighbor uses no such average and thus results in more pronounced colors.</p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>One big problem with texture sampling is that the sample rate of the texture changes dramatically depending on the size of the
   rendered triangle which in turn is dependant on the specific transformations applied. Thus, if we try and render a relatively
   large texture to a small amount of screen space pixels, we will see a large amount of aliasing unless we have a large amount
   of supersampling which will heavily impact performance. One way to get around this is to precompute successively blurred
   versions of the original texture and choose which version we want to sample based on our sample rate. This can be derived by
   calculating the number of texture pixels (texels) incremented for each screen pixel. The way we ended up implementing this was
   using the algorithm described in class where we calculate the texel gradient norm with respect to both screen x and y coordinates
   and take the log2 of the maximum between the two. This gives us our mipmap level which we can clamp to 0-14, our mipmap levels.

   Once we have this mipmap level, we can sample the correct texture. If Linear Level interpolation is used, we sample both the floor
   and ceiling of the clamped mipmap in the same manner as part 5 and linearly interpolate between the two colors based on the floating
   point mipmap level. If we do nearest interpolation, we simply round the clamped mipmap level and only sample that single mip. Finally,
   if Level Zero mode is used, we simpy sample mipmap level zero, just as in part 5.

   All of these levers allow us to improve the image quality with different tradeoffs for memory usage and performance. High levels of
   supersampling make the image look clear no matter which mipmap setting is chosen, but has fairly high memory usage, at least the way
   we are implementing it since we are storing a full supersampled version first then averaging down when we render. If we were to average
   the supersamples before writing into the supersample buffer though, we could remove this cost. Mipmapping has a similar effect to supersampling,
   at least for textured images decreasing the amount of visible aliasing, but doesn't solve aliasing at the edges of triangles and requires
   double the memory to store all the mips. Switching from nearest mipmap level interpolation to linear does make the transition between mipmap
   levels smoother, but the effect is more subtle in the given images and comes with a near doubling in compute cost. When combining supersampling
   with mipmapping, the effect is smother than either effect on it's own but the effect isn't particularly large and it comes at large computational
   cost.
</p>

<p>
  Taking a look at the example below, we see that both mipmapping and texture interpolation can help reduce ailiasing and increase graphical fidelity
  with texture mapped shapes. The default settings without any mipmapping or texture interpolation show pretty major aliasing in the center of the
  image with a lot of jarring high frequency patterns visible in the zoom box. Switching to bilinear texture sampling helps somewhat but doesn't still
  has visible aliasing. Nearest level mipmapping has a much better effect since the texture must be downsampled quite a bit, but still has some artifacts.
  Combining the two techniques leads to an image that is quite smooth and has much fewer visible artifacts, especially when zoomed out.
